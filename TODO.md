List of Bugs & Issues

Forecast Demand in Product Management is not usable yet (the blue/green button does nothing).

Smart Import (OCR) feature is broken and shows a “failed to fetch” error.

In Create Import Product, users cannot manually enter the product name (it was auto-fixed to “banh mi”).

(Skipped – no item 4 provided)

Workflow shows a network error when browsing Google Drive (and possibly other actions).

When clicking Run in Workflow, it only shows “Executing workflow” with no success or failure result.

After running for a while, the workflow becomes extremely slow and freezes; users cannot continue, cancel, or return to the previous task.

Auto Import in the new template is only a placeholder and does not work.

In SE – Auto Import, the Create Automation section uses a JSON Configuration that is too difficult for normal users; it should be simplified.

Saved workflows can be loaded inside the Workflow Builder, but Saved Automations does not show anything on the main menu.

When a user tops up their balance, admin receives no notification, so there is no way to add funds to the user account.

Admin Analytics & Reports are completely placeholders.

In Admin → Manage Subscriptions, clicking the menu always shows the error:
Unexpected token "catch".

In the same section, clicking Send Manual Bank Reconciliation shows the error:
trigger ManualPayout is not defined.

Because of the above issues, Bank Account linking does not work.

Active Managers and Payment History are broken; Manage Subscriptions has serious errors.

In the Business Dashboard, templates are still placeholders.

The Top Up feature in Wallet & Plans feels incorrect — why does the admin need to pay to use their own service?

Since top-up is broken, it is impossible to test or verify the Withdraw Revenue feature (even admin top-ups fail).

Similar to issue #18, it is unclear why admin needs a Manager Upgrade Status — the older version feels more complete than the new one.

In Create User Account (Manager role), Roles & Permissions cannot be used.

Dashboard templates for all three account types are unusable.

Automation Scenarios are unfinished:

Builder page has font/UI bugs

Cannot properly create scenarios

Tutorial button does nothing
