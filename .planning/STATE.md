# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** Demonstrate clean, well-architected AI/ML integration — convince the jury that engineering and methodology are sound
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation and Branch Safety

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation and Branch Safety)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-28 — Roadmap created; phases derived from 25 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Flask Blueprints for routing — standard pattern, proven, well-documented
- [Init]: Services layer for business logic — separation of concerns, testable, matches APP-PY-renew.md
- [Init]: 3-branch strategy (main/dev/demo) — 4+ team members, stable demo required for jury
- [Init]: SQLite stays — no time to migrate, sufficient for demo

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1 risk]: Circular imports will crash app on startup if extensions.py is not created BEFORE Blueprints are extracted — extensions.py must be the first file created in Phase 1
- [Phase 3 risk]: Unqualified `url_for()` calls across Jinja2 templates will silently 404 after Blueprint extraction — audit templates before each Blueprint merge
- [Phase 5 risk]: Evaluation data (real OCR accuracy, LSTM metrics) availability not confirmed — scope this on day 1 of Phase 5
